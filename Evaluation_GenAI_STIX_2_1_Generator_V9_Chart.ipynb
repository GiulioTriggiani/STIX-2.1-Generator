        "## **Objective**\n",
        "The objective is to **quantitatively evaluate** the performance of GenAI_STIX_2_1_Generator, an LLM-based tool for the automatic generation of Cyber Threat Intelligence reports in STIX 2.1 format.  \n",
        "\n",
        "To measure the effectiveness of the generator, this script performs a comparison between a bundle automatically generated by the tool and a reference bundle (“ground truth”) manually created by a CTI analyst.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis leverages the advanced features of the official `stix2` library, in particular a **semantic comparison** is made between the various STIX objects (SDO, SCO, and SRO) to identify not only literal matches, but also matches in meaning.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The data obtained from this comparison is then used to calculate **standard performance metrics** such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, providing a clear and objective assessment of the quality of the generated bundle.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Workflow Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Setup**: installs the Python libraries needed for validating and manipulating STIX objects;\n",
        "2.   **Libraries and Environment**: imports the required modules and mount Google Drive to access the file and set the threshold for comparison;\n",

        "4.   **Metrics**: the function that calculates metrics and various averages\n",
        "5.   **Comparison**: performs the entire process: it browses folders, loads bundles, compares them, and prints the results.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **Micro averaging**\n",
        "*   **Macro averaging**\n",
        "*   **Weighted averaging**\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically:\n",
        "*   **Precision**: This metric answers the question: “Of all the STIX elements that my tool generated, what fraction was actually correct?” A high accuracy score indicates that the tool is reliable and does not generate much “noise” or incorrect information. It is a measure of output quality.\n",
        "*   **Recall**: This metric answers the question: “Of all the correct STIX elements that were present in the report, what fraction did my tool manage to find?” A high recall score indicates that the tool is comprehensive and does not omit much relevant information. It is a measure of coverage.\n",
        "*   **F1-Score**:  The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. It provides a single balanced score that takes both aspects into account. It is particularly useful when you want balanced performance, i.e., when it is equally important to minimize noise (high precision) and maximize coverage (high recall). The F1-Score heavily penalizes systems that excel in one metric at the expense of the other.\n",
        "*   **Micro Averaging**: Micro-averaging gives equal weight to each individual classification decision on an object instance. It answers the question: “Considering all STIX objects extracted from all reports, what percentage of individual instances were handled correctly?” This score will be dominated by performance on the most numerous classes. If the tool is very good at extracting Indicators and IPv4 Addresses (which are very common), the Micro-F1 score will be high, even if performance on rare but important classes such as Campaign or Threat Actor is poor. In a multi-class context, micro-average Precision is equal to micro-average Recall, and therefore to the micro-average F1-Score and overall accuracy.\n",
        "*   **Macro Averaging**: Macro-averaging gives equal weight to each class, regardless of its frequency. It answers the question: “On average, how does my tool perform on different types of CTI concepts?” This score treats the F1-Score for the Threat-Actor class (which may be based on only a few instances) as equally important as the F1-Score for the Indicator class class (based on hundreds of instances). It is a much more indicative measure of the tool's versatility and its ability to handle even the rarest and most difficult types of entities. If the tool performs poorly on a minority class, the Macro-F1 score will be significantly affected.\n",
        "*   **Weighted-Averaging**: This method represents a compromise between Micro and Macro. It attempts to take into account class imbalance (like Micro) while calculating metrics for each type (like Macro). In many scenarios, the Weighted-average result will be very close to that of Micro-average, as both end up giving more importance to classes with more instances."

At the end of the comparison, all objects in the list generated by the tool represent an **FP**, while those in the ground truth list represent an **FN**.\n",

Each is assigned a **weight** (40 and 40 for the two source and destination objects and 20 for the type of relationship). If the similarity threshold is set to 80, the two objects, source and destination, only need to be the same to obtain a similarity. The calculation of FP and FN is similar to the previous one.\n",
